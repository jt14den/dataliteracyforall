### What is data literacy?

see associated slides, [Data_Literacy_for_All_Womack.pdf](https://github.com/ryandata/dataliteracyforall/blob/master/Data_Literacy_for_All_Womack.pdf)

**Statistical literacy** involves the following elements:
- Literacy (reading, but also including handling graphs, charts, and
tables, and other forms of textual evidence)
- Statistical knowledge
- Mathematical knowledge
- Context
- Critical Skills

**Data literacy** requires statistical literacy, but with more emphasis on data wrangling and data exploration.

Prado and Manzi --> "access, interpret, critically assess, manage, handle and ethically use data”

That is a lot. For education, often we need to focus on the core of statistical literacy in a gentle way before getting into the mechanical details of our software tools.

As data professionals, we can do some of the work for our audiences to mask the complexity of the tools and highlight the data itself.

### Packaging Data

RStudio and RMarkdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>

Build Project
<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects>
and
<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486508-Building-Testing-and-Distributing-Packages>
<https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/building-r-packages.html>

R CMD build packagename
R CMD INSTALL packagename

Prepare and extract some data with WDI.R

Structure of a package

devtools
use_data() command


Note the drat package (<https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-026/index.html>) allows for access to larger datasets.  CRAN has a 5 MB limit.

A simple way to get started:

Hadley Wickham's R Packages (Recommended)

### Packaging Functions

Writing a function
Writing documentation
Saving a function
Checking and testing...
Building and sharing a package


Local, e.g.
 library(mypkg, lib.loc = "f:/R-packages")

RForge

Github
quick guide <http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>
-- git init
-- git add*
-- git commit -m "message"
-- git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ryandata/test11111.git
-- git push origin master

install_github("ryandata/test11111")

### Designing functions for data literacy and data exploration

We want to build functions that the end user can quickly apply to their own data exploration needs.

One package designed for this is [mosaic](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024/index.html)

### Interactivity - ggvis and googleVis

[ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com) provides a lightweight way to introduce some dynamic, interactive elements to your plots

googleVis is a relatively self-contained set of tools for quickly generating web-accessible interactive plots.  One downside is that it lacks customizability.

### Interactivity - shiny

[shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) provides a suite of tools to design customized interactive web-accessible data sites, while retaining R for data analysis.

See the shinyapp.R file.

### Interactivity - population pyramid

Our final example illustrates the use of interactivity to uncover population patterns.
